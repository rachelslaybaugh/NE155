\begin{frame}{Fundamental Concept}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Many individual particle histories are simulated
  \item Each physical event is determined by
randomly sampling a \alert{probability distribution}
  \item Each history can contribute to the physical
measurement of interest
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $x_i$ = contribution of history $i$
    \item Different ways to calculate score
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Does particle cross surface?
      \item How much time does particle spend in particular region?
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Set of individual contributions, ${x_i}$,
forms a \textit{probability distribution}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We are interested in the mean value of that contribution, $\overline{x_i}$, and its variance, $S_{\overline{x}}^2$

%\begin{frame}{Two Encounters with Probability Distributions}

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Probability distributions describe the outcome
%of each physical event
%    \item We use \textbf{Random Sampling} techniques to
%evaluate these at each occurrence
%    \item Underlying probability distribution for
%each physical measurement of interest
%    \item We estimate the statistical moments of
%these distributions to get our physical
%answers

\begin{frame}{Two Types of MC Methodology}

\alert{Analog}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Natural laws are \textbf{preserved}
    \item The game is the ``analog" of the physical problem of interest (the history of each particle is simulated exactly)
\end{itemize}
\pause

\alert{Non-Analog}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To reduce computation time, the strict analog simulation of particles is abandoned (i.e.\ we CHEAT)
    \item Variance Reduction techniques:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Absorption suppression
    \item Russian Roulette (history termination)
    \item Splitting (history propagation)
    \item Forced collisions
    \item Source biasing
    \item Hybrid methods
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Analog vs.\ Weighted MC}

\alert{Analog}
\begin{itemize}
    \item No alteration of PDFs
    \item At collision, particle is killed if absorption
    \item Particle is born with weight 1
    \item weight unchanged throughout history
    \item Score when tallying events is 1
\end{itemize}
\pause

\alert{Non-Analog} (weighted)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Alter PDFs to favor events of interest
    \item Particle can have different birth weight
    \item Weight is altered if biased PDF is used
    \item Particle survives ``absorption" and weight is changed
    \item Splitting and RR can change weight
    \item Score current weight when tallying
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Probability \& Statistics Summary}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Rich variety of statistical analysis is
possible.
\pause
\vspace*{.5em}
    \item The difference between accuracy and
precision is important
\pause
\vspace*{.5em}
    \item Accuracy is not always known and can
be difficult to improve
\pause
\vspace*{.5em}
    \item Precision can be improved by more
histories in a measurement, but not
always more histories in a problem
    \end{itemize}
