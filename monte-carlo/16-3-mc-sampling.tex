\begin{frame}{Physics as Probability}

Various physical phenomena can be
represented by probability distributions

\begin{itemize}
  \item Photon emission energy
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Each possible energy has a different probability
(intensity)
    \end{itemize} 
    \pause
    \vspace*{0.5 em}
  \item Scattering cross-sections
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Each possible scattering angle has a different
probability as a function of the energy
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \vspace*{0.5 em}
  \item Transmission through a medium
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Probability of reaching a particular position
depends on the cross-section
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability Density Functions}

All variables, $x$, have a \underline{Probability Density Function (PDF)}, $p(x)$, with the following characteristics:

\begin{frame}{Why Random Sampling}

Various physical phenomena can be
represented by probabilistic distributions

\begin{itemize}
    \item The known probability distribution
represents the \textit{collective} behavior
\vspace*{1em}
    \item We need to know the behavior at \textit{each}
single event
\vspace*{1em}
    \item We need to \underline{recreate} the collective behavior after \underline{many} events
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Random Sampling Purpose}

Use a random process to select a single
value with the following requirements

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each sample should be independent from
other samples
\vspace*{1em}
    \item The PDF formed from a large number of
samples should converge to the initial PDF
\vspace*{1em}
    \item Recover the full resolution of the initial PDF
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Sampling Techniques}

Random sampling uses \underline{uniformly distributed
random variables} to \alert{choose a value for a
variable} according to its probability density
function

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Basic} sampling techniques
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Direct discrete sampling
      \item Continuous discrete sampling
      \item Rejection sampling
      \end{itemize}
    \pause
    \vspace*{.5em}
    \item \textit{Advanced }sampling techniques
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Histogram
      \item Piecewise linear
      \item Alias sampling
      \item Advanced continuous PDFs

Sampling Procedure

    \begin{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Direct Discrete Sampling}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Requires a table search on $P_k$
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Linear search requires $O(N)$ time
      \item Binary search requires $O(\log_2 N)$ time
      \end{itemize}
    \vspace*{.5em}
    \pause
    \item Special case: Uniform discrete PDF
      \begin{itemize}
      \item $p_k = 1/N$
      \item $P_k = k/N$
      \item $k = \left\lfloor{1 + N\xi}\right\rfloor$ (floor function)

\begin{frame}{Direct Continuous Sampling}

    \end{itemize}
    \hspace*{3 em} Generate $\xi$ , \hspace*{1 em} Determine $x = P^{-1}(\xi)$
