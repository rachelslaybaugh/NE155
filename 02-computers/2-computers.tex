\begin{frame}{How do we measure utility?\footnote{\href{en.wikipedia.org}{en.wikipedia.org}}}

\textbf{IPS} (Instructions Per Second) is a measure of a computer's processor speed. IPS can be useful when comparing performance between processors made from a similar architecture, but are difficult to compare between CPU architectures

\vspace*{1 em}
\textbf{Clock rate} typically refers to the frequency at which a CPU is running. It is measured in the SI unit Hertz.

\vspace*{1 em}
\textbf{FLOPS} (FLoating-point Operations Per Second) is a measure of computer performance, useful in fields of scientific calculations that make heavy use of floating-point calculations.

With the advent of the \alert{transistor} and the work on semi-conductors generally, it now seems possible to envisage electronic equipment in a solid block with no connecting wires. The block may consist of layers of insulating, conducting, rectifying and amplifying materials, the \alert{electronic functions being connected directly} by cutting out areas of the various layers.\\

\section{\scshape Parallelism}
\subsection{Parallelism}
\begin{frame}{What is Parallel Architecture?}
A \textcolor{dgreen}{parallel computer} is a collection of processing elements that cooperate to solve large problems
quickly

\begin{itemize}
\item Resource allocation
  \begin{itemize}
  \item How much \textcolor{dgreen}{memory}?
  \item How \textcolor{dgreen}{many} elements?
  \item How \textcolor{dgreen}{powerful} are the elements?
  \end{itemize}
\item Data access, Communication, and Synchronization
  \begin{itemize}
  \item How do the elements cooperate and \textcolor{dgreen}{communicate}?
  \item How are \textcolor{dgreen}{data transmitted} between processors?
  \item What are the \textcolor{dgreen}{abstractions} and primitives for cooperation?
  \end{itemize}
\item Performance and Scalability
  \begin{itemize}
  \item How does it all translate into \textcolor{dgreen}{performance}?
  \item How does it \textcolor{dgreen}{scale}?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Forms of Parallelism}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bit level}: increases in word size reduced the \# of instructions the processor needs
\item \textbf{Instruction level}: hardware and/or software perform operations simultaneously when possible
\item \textbf{Memory system}: overlap of memory operations with computation
\item \textbf{Operating system}: multiple jobs run in parallel on commodity symmetric multiprocessors (SMPs) 
\end{itemize}
There are limitations to all of these

\vspace*{1 em}
To achieve high performance, the programmer needs to identify, schedule, and coordinate parallel tasks and data

\vspace*{1 em}
\item \textbf{Weak Scaling}: increase element count and problem size to keep problem size per element fixed (solve bigger problems)\\

%\item \textbf{Distributed Shared Memory}: each node of a cluster has access to a large shared memory in addition to each node's limited non-shared private memory.
