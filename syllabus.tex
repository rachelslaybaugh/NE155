  \item 4: A, demonstrates mastery of topics (shows work illustrating the correct solution was achieved with correct steps)
  \item 3: B, demonstrates knowledge about topics (answer may be incorrect, but many steps are correct / pointing in the right direction)
  \item 2: C, demonstrates some understanding of topics (some key steps may be missing or incorrect, but work is headed in a valid direction)
  \item 1: D, demonstrates very limited understanding of topics (some steps are correct, and some correct approaches are included)

\noindent There will not be graded homework this semester. I will release homework assignments and then when the homework would normally be due I will release the solutions. I encourage you to treat this like normal homework and then assess yourself to see how you did. I will hold two office hours each week to answer homework questions rather than just one.

\noindent\textbf{Academic Honesty}:  Berkeley's honor code is

\begin{quote}
As a member of the UC Berkeley community, I act with honesty, integrity, and respect for others.
\end{quote}

\noindent The University provides some basic guidance about academic integrity: \url{http://sa.berkeley.\\edu/conduct/integrity}. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to the academic honesty policy should be directed to me.

%\vskip.25in
%\noindent My policy is that you may work together on homework, \textit{but you must specifically cite with whom you worked and what you did together}.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Extra Help}:  Do not hesitate to come to my office during office hours or by appointment to discuss a homework problem or any aspect of the course. 

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Attendance}: Students are encouraged to attend classes regularly. I recognize this is a strange semester and you may be watching the videos asynchronously. %A student who incurs an excessive number of absences may be withdrawn from this class at my discretion.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Everyone is welcome}:
Diversity is a defining feature of the University of California and we embrace it as a source of strength. Our differences of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, socioeconomic status, abilities, experience and more, enhance our ability to achieve the university?s core missions of public service, teaching, and research. In this class we embrace diversity and welcome students from all backgrounds and want everyone in the room to feel respected and valued.

\vskip.25in
\noindent\textbf{Code of Conduct}:
We'll abide by this code of conduct:\\ \url{https://www.goodenergycollective.org/code-of-conduct}

\noindent\textit{Center for Access to Engineering Excellence (CAEE)}                        	          
The Center for Access to Engineering Excellence (227 Bechtel Engineering Center;
\url{https://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/academic-support}) is an inclusive center that offers study spaces, nutritious snacks, and tutoring in >50 courses for Berkeley engineers and other majors across campus.  The Center also offers a wide range of professional development, leadership, and wellness programs, and loans clickers, laptops, and professional attire for interviews. \\
 
\noindent\textit{Disabled Students' Program (DSP)}
The Disabled Student's Program (260 C\'{e}sar Ch\'{a}vez Student Center \#4250; 510-642-0518;  \url{http://dsp.berkeley.edu}) serves students with disabilities of all kinds. Services are individually designed and based on the specific needs of each student as identified by DSP's Specialists.\\
 
\noindent\textit{Counseling and Psychological Services}    	 
The main University Health Services Counseling and Psychological Services staff is located at the Tang Center (\url{http://uhs.berkeley.edu}; 2222 Bancroft Way; 642-9494) and provides confidential assistance to students managing problems that can emerge from illness such as financial, academic, legal, family concerns, and more.\\
 
\noindent To improve access for engineering students, a licensed psychologist from the Tang Center also holds walk-in appointments for confidential counseling in 241 Bechtel Engineering Center (check here for schedule: \url{https://engineering.berkeley.edu/student-services/advising-counseling}). \\
 
\noindent\textit{The Care Line (PATH to Care Center)}
The Care Line (510-643-2005; \url{https://care.berkeley.edu/care-line/}) is a 24/7, confidential, free, campus-based resource for urgent support around sexual assault, sexual harassment, interpersonal violence, stalking, and invasion of sexual privacy. The Care Line will connect you with a confidential advocate for trauma-informed crisis support including time-sensitive information, securing urgent safety resources, and accompaniment to medical care or reporting.\\
 
\noindent\textit{Ombudsperson for Students}                                   	             
The Ombudsperson for Students (102 Sproul Hall; 642-5754; \url{http://students.berkeley.edu/Ombuds})  provides a confidential service for students involved in a University-related problem (academic or administrative), acting as a neutral complaint resolver and not as an advocate for any of the parties involved in a dispute. The Ombudsman can provide information on policies and procedures affecting students, facilitate students' contact with services able to assist in resolving the problem, and assist students in complaints concerning improper application of University policies or procedures. All matters referred to this office are held in strict confidence. The only exceptions, at the sole discretion of the Ombudsman, are cases where there appears to be imminent threat of serious harm.\\
 
\noindent\textit{UC Berkeley Food Pantry}                   
The UC Berkeley Food Pantry (\#68 Martin Luther King Student Union; \url{https://pantry.berkeley.edu}) aims to reduce food insecurity among students and staff at UC Berkeley, especially the lack of nutritious food. Students and staff can visit the pantry as many times as they need and take as much as they need while being mindful that it is a shared resource. The pantry operates on a self-assessed need basis; there are no eligibility requirements.  The pantry is not for students and staff who need supplemental snacking food, but rather, core food support.\\
